I consider it a privilege to be here tonight to join with you in the greatest of all charities – the helping of the aged poor. The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts Order of the Sons of Italy, who have made this evening’s kick-off dinner possible, and all those who are participating so actively in this worthy cause, are to be congratulated. No words of mine can express to those saintly apostles of charity – the Sons of Divine Providence – what we think of them. No language is rich enough to tell the story of their charitable works, not only in Italy but throughout the world. 

I think the Holy Father, Pope Pius the 12th, expressed what we all think when he called Don Orione "the outstanding apostle of Charity – father of the poor and comforter of suffering and abandoned Humanity." If that priest of charity, the founder of the Sons of Divine Providence – whose tenth anniversary we are celebrating this year, could be present tonight and see this tremendous and enthusiastic gathering of Americans of Italian descent participating in the drive for care of the aged, he would be proud that his message of charity has been carried by his people to the new world. 

At this present time there are nine aged women being cared for at the rest home. It is staffed by six nuns and by four priests. Father Phil Octtavi already has more than 300 applications for admittance to the home. The present site at Orient Heights of the home is outstanding. But it is not adequate to care for those in need. This new home is desperately wanted. The aged poor must be cared for and I am sure that you will exceed your quota of $15,000.

Certainly, with the example of Don Orione's life of charity before us, we cannot fail. And these words, written when he was a young man should be of comfort to us in these days of trouble. "I seem to dream and I saw a new heaven and a new earth."
